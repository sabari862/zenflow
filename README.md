Clean UI and responsive design for both Android and iOS

Floating Action Button for quick task creation

Tabs and search filters to easily sort and locate tasks

Pull-to-refresh and swipe-to-delete for fluid interactions

No-task states with friendly visuals for empty lists

Offline-friendly task handling (local session storage)

Crash reporting through Firebase Crashlytics for reliability

The app is structured with a modular architecture and scalable component design, ensuring maintainability beyond the hackathon. ZenFlow reflects thoughtful design and efficient development under tight deadlines — delivering a polished, usable MVP within just 48 hours
